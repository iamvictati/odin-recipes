This project is to build my HTML chops in the real world by building a recipe website that contains and index and stuff. 

I've already kind of done this in freeCodeCamp but it isn't part of my GitHub portfolio. 

After I'm done with this, I can come back and make it all pretty. 

Happy happy!!! ^.^
