    <h2>Ok, just make this, it's super easy. You can use virtually any vegetable of choice for this risotto. A child can make this.</h2>

        <p>If you have any saved chicken stock, beef stock or even fish stock in your freezer, wip up some parmesan cheese or pecorino and you are good to go.</p>

        <p>No stock? Use some stock powder or cubes and make some quick fake stock. The only weird ingredient you might not have is celery. Alright, let me get to it.</p>

        <p>Risotto is brilliant. You're welcome.</p>
