                <li>4 white potatoes</li>
                <li>Olive oil/Sunflower oil</li>
                <li>Ginger</li>
                <li>Coconut Milk</li>
                <li>Black Pepper</li>
                <li>Curry Powder</li>

        <h2 class="ing-steps">Steps:</h2>

            <ul type="circle">
                <li >
                    <strong>Step 1:</strong>

                    <p>Let's begin by making cutting all the meat into squared chunks. The size depends on your preference.</p>

                    <p>Then we proceed to heat up oil in a big pot, not a pan, a pot. Once the olive oil or sunflower oil is hot enough, throw all the meat chunks in there. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 2:</strong>

                    <p>As the meat begins to fry, you can chop the 2 onions, ginger, garlic and sweet chilies.</p>

                    <p>Once the meat is relatively fried, you can add all the chopped ingredients.Make sure the pot has enough oil for all the meat and ingredients to create a sofrito.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 3:</strong>

                    <p>Once you feel the sofrito is flowing, add the curry powder or curry paste. Lots of it, dont be shy. If you don't like strong stuff, this food isn't for you. Go big or go home, man.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 4:</strong>

                    <p>Alright, shake it about with your wooden spoon, make sure the curry gets everywhere. Let the curry cook in the oil for it to activate.</p>

                    <p>It goes without saying that you should obviously add loads of black pepper and salt. That's just common knowledge.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 5:</strong>

                    <p>Add that water man! Ok, so you might have thought the coconut milk was for the talkari, well no. It's for the rice, dude. </p>

                    <p>Add enough water to cover the entire pot, beef takes long to cook. Might take about 2 hours. If it's chicken, takes about an hour or so.</p>

                    <p>You can make the process faster but remember that you want the meat to be tender and soft, not chewy and difficult. Be patient. </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 6:</strong>

                    <p>Mmmm just wait and then add the potatoes, right, we forgot the potatoes!</p>
                    
                    <p>Make sure they are cut into squared chunks too. Not to small because they'll begin to desintegrate and this is what will give the talkari a saucy dense texture. Chuck them in there!</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 7:</strong>
                    <p>Just wait now until it simmers and cooks and turns a bit dense.</p>

                    <p>Once you feel it's ready, move to the last and most important step.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 8:</strong>
                    <p>ADD SOME CHOPPED CILANTRO!!! <small>(Secret fantastic ingredient. Don't add any if you plan on eating it with roti. Check the roti recipe. ^.^) </small></p>
                </li>
